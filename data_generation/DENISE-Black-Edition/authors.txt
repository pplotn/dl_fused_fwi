The DENISE Black-Edition code was first developed by Daniel Köhn, Denise De Nil and Andre Kurzmann 
at Christian-Albrechts-Universität Kiel and TU Bergakademie Freiberg (Germany) from 2005 to 2009.

The isotropic elastic forward code is partly based on the viscoelastic FD code fdveps (now SOFI2D) by 
Thoams Bohlen [2002]. Different external libraries for timedomain filtering are used.
